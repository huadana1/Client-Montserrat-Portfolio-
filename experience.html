    <h1>My Working Experiences!</h1>

    <p id = "experience">
      Hi! I'm currently still in high school right now, so I don't have much
      working experience. However, I have been working at <strong><em>PetCo</em></strong>
      for the past year, every since I have turned 16. I hope this will not change
      your opinion about my technical skills!
    </p>
