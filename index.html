      <p>
        Hi, my name is Montserrat Ruiz! I  am an incoming senior interested in the arts.
        I would love to be a designer, such as a fashion designer or graphic designer.
        I am also in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. This is my portfolio
        and I hope you will get in touch!
